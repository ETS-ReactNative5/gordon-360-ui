Gordon 360 React Proof of Concept
---------------------------------

## Getting Started
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Read the user guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

To run the app for the first time, run the following commands:  
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

The app will open in a browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Editor Recommendations
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended editor for this project. This editor is a lightweight IDE that has excellent support for JavaScript and other web languages. It also has a built-in terminal, Git integration, a debugger, and a rich extension ecosystem.  

The following extensions are recommended for any editor used to develop this project, but the links provided are for the VS Code extensions:
- [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) ensures that indentation style, line endings, and file endings are consistent across editors and operating systems
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) checks JavaScript syntax and style, reducing bugs and improving consistency across a development team

If you are using VS Code, you can use the following keyboard shortcut to run the app:
- macOS: <kbd>⌘</kdb><kbd>⇧</kdb><kbd>B</kdb>
- Windows: <kbd>Ctrl</kdb>+<kbd>⇧</kdb>+<kbd>B</kdb>
