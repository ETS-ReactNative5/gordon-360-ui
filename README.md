Gordon 360 React Proof of Concept
---------------------------------

## Getting Started
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Read the user guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

To run the app for the first time, run the following commands:  
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

The app will open in a browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Editor Recommendations
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended editor for this project. This editor is a lightweight IDE that has excellent support for JavaScript and other web languages. It also has a built-in terminal, Git integration, a debugger, and a rich extension ecosystem.  

The following extensions are recommended for any editor used to develop this project, but the links provided are for the VS Code extensions:
- [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) ensures that indentation style, line endings, and file endings are consistent across editors and operating systems
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) checks JavaScript syntax and style, reducing bugs and improving consistency across a development team

If you are using VS Code, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts to run the app:
- macOS: <kbd>⌘</kdb><kbd>⇧</kdb><kbd>B</kdb>
- Windows: <kbd>Ctrl</kdb>+<kbd>⇧</kdb>+<kbd>B</kdb>

VS Code users will also see a ruler at the 100 character mark, helping the developer to avoid linter warnings by keeping lines under 100 characters long.  

## Libraries
Links to the homepages of libraries used in this project, listed here for easy reference.
- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy)
Provides easy routing, allowing transitions between views with back button support and URL management.
- [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)
Bootstrap 4 implemented in React components. Though [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) is more widely used and has a more mature API, it only supports Bootstrap 3. Bootstrap 4 brings significant improvements, so it is worthwhile to go with reactstrap, a younger library, to be able to take advantage of those improvements.
